# there is a 3rd possible way to do it with only one hop of encryption
# but it seems that wtrw doesn't allow it.
# 1. Make desktop client connect to wtrw:12001
# 2. On wtrw:
    ssh -t -L 12001:lob116:11111 lo-fe1
# forwarding connection to wtrw:12001 to lob116:11111 through lo-fe1
# Communication from desktop client to wtrw is NOT encrypted, communcation
# between wtrw to lo-fe1 is encrypted, communication from lo-fe1 to lo-be
# is again NOT encrypted

# wtrw also doesn't allow encrypted communication to lo-fe1 so this one
# (forwarding desktop:19001 to lo-fe1:19002 through wtrw, means
# desktop<-ssh->wtrw and wtrw<-tcp->lo-fe1) does NOT work
