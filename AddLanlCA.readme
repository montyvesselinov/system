This is a personalized AddLanlCA.sh script for you that should work in sh. 
If you are the only one that uses the particular server that was exhibiting 
the error feel free to put this file in /etc/profile.d/ directory and overwrite
the previous version. If this server is being used by others and they are not
all using sh as their preferred shell, put this file somewhere else and 
manually run it. You may also want to create a cron job that runs this script
on a regular basis.
